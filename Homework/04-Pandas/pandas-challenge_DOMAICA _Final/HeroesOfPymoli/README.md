# Pandas Homework - IGNACIO DOMAICA

# Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli

### Stored solution

* As requested, created a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`.
  I have modified the name to identify it better inside my folders so the final name is: `pandas-challenge_DOMAICA_Final`
  Inside it I created 1 new folder, `HeroesOfPymoli` to proceed with homework

* Still not using GitHub. It is not properly installed in my notebook. Reserved some session with my Teacher Assistant to get it done next week.

* Inside the folder `pandas-challenge_DOMAICA-Final` , you can find following stuff:

  * Folder `HeroesOfPymoli`

  * Inside it you will see 3 new files
        1./ called `README.md`. This is the current script you are reading
        2./ `HeroesOfPymoli_FINAL_DOMAICA_commented.ipynb` solution
        3./ `Observable_Trends_Based_On_Data.pptx` which contains descriptions & conclusions requested after analysis of data.

      and 2 folders:
        3./ .ipynb_checkpoints with ipynb_checkpoints of ipndb
        4./ `Resources` folder with csv needed to build Solution

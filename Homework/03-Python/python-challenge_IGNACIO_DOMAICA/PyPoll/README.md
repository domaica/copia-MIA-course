# Python Homework - IGNACIO DOMAICA

# PyPoll SOLUTION

### Stored solution

* As requested, created a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`.
  Inside it I created 2 new folders, `PyBank` and `PyPoll` to proceed with both homeworks respectively as it was required # Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

* Still not using GitHub. Hopefully I will progress in that regard. Yet not confident enough.

* Inside the folder `PyPoll` , you can find following stuff:

  * A new file called `main_PyPoll.py`. This is the main script to run for PyPoll solution.
  * A `Resources-PyPoll` folder has been created & contains the CSV files I used.
    Inside this folder you can also find a file named: `election_test.csv`. It contains a subset of biggest data .csv for testing purposes
  * An `Analysis-PyPoll` folder contains the text file that has the results from your analysis.
    It also contains a PowerPoint with some print screens with results of this analysis called: `Solution PyPoll results.pptx`


## PyPoll

Regarding Python script main challenges or remarks have been:

  * I save versions every time I get a meaningful result. In this project I have reached up to 9 versions, so I improved compared with PyBank exercise, getting results
    with less iterations

  * I used functions since the start in this project to split portions of code.

  * In this case the main .csv file for the analysis was huge, so of course you have to test always with smaller subsets of data

  * My main problem in this project has been to get final printing results rounding percentages to 3 decimals. I have been unable to solve it although in dictionary
    I have operated it to round in to 3 decimals correctly, but I have a problem with the printing. I remember I already show it before in the right way, but
    now I have been trying to solve using different methods, but it has not been possible to solve it and I am running out of time.
